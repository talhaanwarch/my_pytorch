# my_pytorch_projects
 I have started learning pytorch and this repo comprised of propject i did  
Jouney of pytorch learning started from [youtube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIsg-ZUy0MY)   
- 1-basic - comprised of how to create a very simple neural net (data used is some random linear regression csv file)  
- 2-mnist_basic - how to use logistic regression (a simple neural net) for mnist classification
- 3-mnist_basic_gpu - how to use gpu instead of cpu for mnist classification using simple neural net  
- 4-cifar_cnn.py - how to classify custom data and how to load it. neural net is extended to basic convnet   
- 5-triplet_faces- how to create vgg16 and use custom data loader along with custom loss function. This is a some sort of project which used triplet loss to find similar face. Andrew NG [convolution neural network](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6jfw8MuKwpI) helps alot . [Github repo by harveyslash](https://github.com/harveyslash/Facial-Similarity-with-Siamese-Networks-in-Pytorch) help me alot to understand custom data loader and loss function. [Debapriya-Tula repo in keras](https://github.com/Debapriya-Tula/Face-Verification/) also helpful for creating triplets  
- 6-6-contrastive_faces this idea is mostly inspired from [Github repo by harveyslash](https://github.com/harveyslash/Facial-Similarity-with-Siamese-Networks-in-Pytorch)
